# PRUPixels
In these turbulent times, it's sometimes necessary to let ourselves be distracted by the wonders of physics and electronics, and the magical phenomena they can produce. Thatâ€™s the spirit behind this project.
This is certainly not a ready-made solution fit for production. Rather, the intention is to demonstrate how the microcontroller on the BeagleBone, using its PRU, can be used to generate serial LED data for WS and SK-type LED drivers, based on a locally stored MP4 video.
Perhaps this project could also serve as a starting point for those with the ambition to create controllers for use in events and architectural applications. Who knows...
